      content: '<p>I curated guidelines and examples to be relevant to the social workers’ day-to-day activities to help them make the connection between my examples and their relevant usage. Generic and unspecific examples are a surefire way to have the audience dismiss practical advice under the assumption that they’re not relevant.</p>'
